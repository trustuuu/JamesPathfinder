      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 cups cooked white rice\n",
      "- 1 carrot, julienned\n",
      "- 1 zucchini, julienned\n",
      "- 1 cup spinach\n",
      "- 1 cup bean sprouts\n",
      "- 4 shiitake mushrooms, sliced\n",
      "- 1/2 pound beef (you can use ribeye or sirloin), thinly sliced\n",
      "- 4 eggs\n",
      "- 4 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red chili paste)\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Sesame seeds for garnish\n",
      "- Vegetable oil for cooking\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Marinate the beef: In a bowl, mix the beef with soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.\n",
      "2. Cook the rice according to package instructions and set aside.\n",
      "3. In a pan, heat some vegetable oil over medium heat. Cook the marinated beef until browned and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n",
      "4. In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed and saut√© the carrots, zucchini, spinach, bean sprouts, and shiitake mushrooms separately until just cooked. Season each with a little salt and pepper.\n",
      "5. In another pan, fry the eggs sunny side up or to your liking.\n",
      "6. To assemble the Bibimbap, divide the rice among four bowls. Arrange the cooked vegetables and beef on top of the rice. Place a fried egg on top of each bowl.\n",
      "7. Serve the Bibimbap with a dollop of gochujang on top and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n",
      "8. Mix everything together before eating to enjoy all the flavors combined.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Heat some vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat and cook the marinated tofu until browned and slightly crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n",
      "\n",
